## Architecture

cHATBOX uses a microservices architecture with four backend services behind a Kong API Gateway:

```
                          +-----------+
                          |  Frontend |  (React + Nginx, port 80)
                          +-----+-----+
                                |
                          +-----+-----+
                          |   Kong    |  (API Gateway, port 80)
                          |  Gateway  |
                          +-----+-----+
                                |
          +----------+----------+----------+----------+
          |          |          |          |          |
     /api/auth  /ws/chat  /api/messages  /api/files
          |          |          |          |
    +-----+----+ +--+------+ +-+--------+ +--+------+
    |  Auth    | |  Chat   | | Message  | |  File   |
    | Service  | | Service | | Service  | | Service |
    | (Python) | |  (Go)   | | (Python) | | (Node)  |
    | :8001    | | :8003   | | :8004    | | :8005   |
    +-----+----+ +--+------+ +-+--------+ +--+------+
          |          |          |          |
     +----+---+ +---+----+ +--+-----+ +--+-----+
     |Postgres| | Redis  | |Postgres| |Postgres|
     | (auth) | | PubSub | | (msgs) | | (files)|
     +--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+
                     |
                  +--+---+
                  | Kafka |
                  +------+
```

Each service owns its own database (database-per-service pattern), communicates asynchronously via Kafka, and is independently deployable.

---

## Quick Start

### Option A: Full Stack (Docker) — Recommended

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # configure environment
make deploy            # build all images + start all services + restart Kong
```

> **Why `make deploy` and not `docker compose up -d --build`?**
> Kong caches DNS at startup. When app containers are rebuilt and get new internal IPs, Kong still routes to the old IPs (502 errors) until it is restarted. `make deploy` handles this automatically — it rebuilds, starts, then restarts Kong so it re-resolves service names. See the [Makefile Reference](docs/development/makefile-reference.md) for all Docker Compose targets.

Services available at:
- **App**: http://localhost (Kong gateway routes all traffic)
- **Auth Service**: http://localhost:8001 (direct) or http://localhost/api/auth
- **Chat Service**: http://localhost:8003 (direct) or ws://localhost/ws/chat
- **Message Service**: http://localhost:8004 (direct) or http://localhost/api/messages
- **File Service**: http://localhost:8005 (direct) or http://localhost/api/files

### Option B: Local Development (recommended for daily work)

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# 2. Start each microservice natively (in separate terminals)
cd services/auth-service && source venv/bin/activate && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
cd services/chat-service && go run ./cmd/...
cd services/message-service && source venv/bin/activate && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8004
cd services/file-service && npm install && npm run dev

# 3. Start frontend (in a new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend at **http://localhost:5173** | Services at ports **8001, 8003, 8004, 8005**

> **Note:** In local dev without Kong, the frontend `.env` must point directly to service ports. In Docker, Kong handles all routing through port 80.

### Option C: Kubernetes (kind — local cluster)

Run the full platform on a local Kubernetes cluster using `kind`.

**Prerequisites:** Docker, `kubectl`, `kind`, `helm` — see [docs/operations/k8s-operations.md](docs/operations/k8s-operations.md) for install instructions.

```bash
# 1. Spin up the cluster, install infra, build images, and deploy everything
make k8s-setup-local

# 2. Verify all pods are running
make k8s-status

# 3. Run the full E2E test suite (46 tests covering every service)
bash infra/k8s/scripts/e2e-test.sh
```

Services available at:
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:30000
- **API (Kong):** http://localhost:30080
- **Grafana:** http://localhost:30030 (admin / admin)
- **Prometheus:** `make k8s-prometheus` (port-forwards to http://localhost:9090)

Tear everything down when done:
```bash
make k8s-teardown
```

### Option D: Legacy Monolith (reference only)

The original monolith is preserved at `v1/backend/` for reference. See [v1/backend/](v1/backend/) if you need to run it.

## Features

### Core
- **Multi-room chat** — Three default rooms (politics, sports, movies) + create custom rooms
- **Real-time messaging** — Native WebSocket with Redis pub/sub relay for multi-worker support
- **Private messages** — Direct messaging between users with online/offline presence indicators
- **File sharing** — Upload and download files in rooms (up to 150 MB)
- **Durable persistence** — Messages flow through Kafka for async database writes with DLQ support
- **Room admin controls** — Kick, mute/unmute, promote users, auto admin succession
- **Global admin panel** — Manage all rooms, users, and files from a dedicated dashboard

### Phase 1 Features (v2)
- **Message editing** — Edit your own sent messages; an "(edited)" badge is shown to all users in real time via WebSocket. Only the original sender can edit. Persisted in PostgreSQL with `edited_at` timestamp.
- **Message deletion** — Soft-delete your own messages; the content is replaced with "[deleted]" for all users in real time. The original content is preserved in the database (`is_deleted` flag) for audit purposes.
- **Emoji reactions** — React to any message with emojis using an integrated emoji picker (emoji-mart). Reactions are broadcast in real time and persisted in a `reactions` table with a unique constraint per user/emoji/message. Click an existing reaction to toggle it on/off.
- **Typing indicators** — See who is currently typing in a room. Typing events are broadcast via WebSocket (excluded from the sender) and auto-clear after 3 seconds of inactivity.
- **Read position tracking** — The server tracks each user's last-read message per room. On reconnect, the frontend receives the read position and renders a "New messages" divider. Positions are updated when the user sends a `mark_read` WebSocket command.
- **Message search** — Full-text search across all messages using PostgreSQL `tsvector` with GIN indexing for relevance-ranked results. Accessible via the Search button (or Ctrl+K). Results show sender, room, timestamp, and highlighted matching terms. Supports optional `room_id` filtering.
- **Link previews** — When a message contains a URL, the frontend fetches OpenGraph metadata (title, description, image) from the message-service's `/link-preview` endpoint and renders a compact preview card. Results are cached client-side for the session duration. The backend validates URLs against SSRF attacks (blocks private IPs, cloud metadata endpoints).
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** — TOTP-based 2FA via the Settings panel. Users scan a QR code with Google Authenticator or Authy, then verify with a 6-digit code. TOTP secrets are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM (`TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`). A manual entry key is available for apps that can't scan QR codes.
- **Browser notifications** — Desktop notifications for @mentions. When another user mentions you with `@username`, a browser notification is sent (requires notification permission). Mention detection is case-insensitive.
- **Online presence** — Lobby-based presence tracking. Each user maintains a lobby WebSocket connection independent of room connections. When the last lobby connection closes (full logout), `user_offline` is broadcast to all connected users. On login, `user_online` is broadcast. This decouples presence from room membership — a user can leave a room without appearing offline.

### Phase 2 Features (feat/pm-files-and-persistence)
- **PM file sharing** — Upload and download files in direct message conversations. Files are stored securely with participant-only authorization — only the sender and recipient can download a private file. Images render as inline previews; other files show a download button.
- **PM history persistence** — DM message history is fetched from the server on first open and lazy-loaded per conversation. The `message-service` exposes a `GET /messages/pm/history/{username}` endpoint backed by a dedicated DB index for efficient participant-pair queries.
- **PM sidebar persistence** — The DM sidebar (list of conversations) is saved to `localStorage` and restored on page reload, so conversations reappear without needing to receive a new message first.
- **Instant logout presence** — On logout the frontend sends an explicit `{"type":"logout"}` message over the lobby WebSocket before closing it. The server skips the 5-second reconnect grace period and immediately broadcasts `user_left` to all rooms. Page refreshes are unaffected — the grace period still applies when the socket closes without the logout signal.
- **PM clear history UX fix** — Clearing a conversation's history empties the messages but keeps the contact in the sidebar. Previously the contact icon disappeared until the next page reload.

### Infrastructure
- **Graceful degradation** — Works without Kafka (sync fallback) and without Redis (local-only delivery)
- **Health checks** — `/health` (liveness) and `/ready` (readiness) endpoints per service
- **Rate limiting** — Per-IP rate limits with Redis-backed state in production
- **Structured logging** — Human-readable in dev, JSON in production
- **Microservices** — Polyglot backend (Python, Go, Node.js) with Kong API Gateway

## Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize. Key variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `APP_ENV` | `dev` | Environment mode: `dev`, `staging`, `prod` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | (change me) | JWT signing key (shared across all services) |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `chatbox` | PostgreSQL superuser |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `chatbox_pass` | PostgreSQL password |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379/0` | Redis connection |
| `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` | `localhost:29092` | Kafka broker address (host), `kafka:9092` (Docker) |
| `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | (generate) | AES-256-GCM key for encrypting 2FA TOTP secrets (`python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`) |
| `KONG_DATABASE` | `off` | Kong config mode (dbless) |

Each service connects to its own database (`chatbox_auth`, `chatbox_chat`, `chatbox_messages`, `chatbox_files`) created automatically by the init script.

See the [Operations Runbook](docs/operations/runbook.md) for full configuration reference.
